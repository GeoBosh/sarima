\arguments{
  \item{acf}{autocorrelations.}
  \item{n}{length of the corresponding time series.}
  \item{npar}{number of df to subtract.}
  \item{nlags}{
    number of autocorrelations to use for the portmonteau
    statistic, can be a vector to request several such statistics.
  }
  \item{method}{
    a character string, one of "LiMcLeod", "LjungBox" or "BoxPierce".
  }
  \item{interval}{
    a number or NULL.
  }
  \item{expandCI}{
    logical flag, if \code{TRUE} return a CI for each lag up to
    \code{max(nlags)}. Used only if CI's are requested.
  }
  \item{...}{
    additional arguments passed on to methods. In particular, some
    methods have argument \code{x} for the time series.
  }
}
\details{

  Performs one of several tests for IID based on sample
  autocorrelations. A correction of the degrees of freedom
  for residuals from fitted models can be specified with argument
  \code{npar}. \code{nlags} specifies the number of autocorrelations to
  use in the test, it can be a vector to request several tests.

  The results of the test are gathered in a matrix with one row for each
  element of \code{nlags}. The test statistic is in column "ChiSq",
  degrees of freedom in "DF" and the p-value in "pvalue". The method is
  in attribute "method".

  If \code{interval} is not \code{NULL} confidence intervals for the
  autocorrelations are computed, under the null hypothesis of
  independence. The coverage probability (or probabilities) is
  speciified by \code{interval}.

  If argument \code{expandCI} is \code{TRUE}, there is one row
  for each lag, up to \code{max(nlags)}. It is best to use this feature
  with a single coverage probability.

  If \code{expandCI} to \code{FALSE} the confidence intervals are put in
  a matrix with one row for each coverage probability.

}
\value{
  a list with components "test" and (if requested) "ci", as described in
  Details
}
\section{Methods}{
\describe{

\item{\code{signature(acf = "ANY")}}{

  In this method \code{acf} contains the autocorrelations.

}

\item{\code{signature(acf = "missing")}}{

  The autocorrelations are computed from argument \code{x} (the time series).

}

\item{\code{signature(acf = "SampleAutocorrelations")}}{

  This is a convenience method in which argument \code{n} is taken from
  \code{acf} and thus does not need to be specified by the user.
